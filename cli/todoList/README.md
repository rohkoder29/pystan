## What does the program do?

The program lets you set tasks you are wiling to complete. You can perform most generic actions, like ***create*** new tasks or ***modify*** existing ones, ***delete*** tasks (if you've already completed them or don't want to do so anymore), ***show*** pending tasks and statistics of all tasks (date created, marked as completed, pending or completed tasks).


## How you use the program?

In a shell (cmd on Windows, ba/z/fi/sh or any other on UNIX-like systems) you type `todo` or `.\todo` in Windows, and `./todo` in UNIX-like systems to run the program. Once launched it will provide a *list* of options to perform the desired actions within the program.
