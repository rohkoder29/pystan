Create a todo list

* Collection 
    - is a set of tasks
    - has a name / title
    - is kinda container
    - has a state: completed or not
        example: groceries
    Actions: CRUD

* Task
    - step to complete a collection
    - has a description
        example: buy peaches
    Actions: CRUD

* Menu
    - how things are being shown
    (maybe use/learn the rich module)

I guess I'll have to use regex to verify name / description of 
collection / task
