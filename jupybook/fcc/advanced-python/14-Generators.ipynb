    "# Generators\n",
    "Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed on the fly, returning an object that can be iterated over. Unlike lists, they are lazy and thus produce items one at a time and only when asked. So they are much more memory efficient when dealing with large datasets.  \n",

    "def my_generator():\n",

    "## Execution of a generator function\n",
    "Calling the function does not execute it. Instead, the function returns a generator object which is used to control execution. Generator objects execute when `next()` is called. When calling `next()` the first time, execution begins at the start of the function and continues until the first `yield` statement where the value to the right of the statement is returned. Subsequent calls to `next()` continue from the `yield` statement (and loop around) until another `yield` is reached. If `yield` is not called because of a condition or the end is reached, a `StopIteration exception` is raised:"

It has to implement `__iter__` and `__next__` to make it iterable, keep track of the current state (the current number in this case), and take care of a `StopIteration`. It can be used to understand the concept behind generators. However, there is a lot of boilerplate code, and the logic is not as clear as with a simple function using the `yield` keyword. "
